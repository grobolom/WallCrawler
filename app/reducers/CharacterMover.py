class CharacterMover:
    """
    this is a reducer that handles moving the character. While later we will
    probably want to allow any object to fire move events, we can refactor as
    necessary. It's also more complex - we need to treat all objects as
    movable and need to be able to pick them out of the list of objects
    easily. Maybe it's easier to use something other than a plain list but
    we will tackle it when we get there.
